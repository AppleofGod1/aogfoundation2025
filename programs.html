        The Apple of God Foundation runs targeted programs that address the core needs of underserved children and families. We focus on education, empowerment, and sustainable impact through the following key initiatives:
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ“š 50 Smiles Back to School</h3>
      <p>
        Our flagship initiative provides complete school kits to 50 children from low-income families each year. The kits include uniforms, books, shoes, and writing materials. This program helps ease the financial burden on parents and ensures children start the school year ready to learn.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸŒŸ Skills for Tomorrow</h3>
      <p>
        A vocational training project designed to equip teenagers with practical skills like tailoring, crafts, and computer literacy. We believe in empowering youth to break the cycle of poverty with tools for self-sufficiency.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸŽ‰ Holiday Care Drive</h3>
      <p>
        Every holiday season, we organize care drivesâ€”providing food, clothing, and festive items to families in need, bringing warmth and joy to those who might otherwise be forgotten.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ“– Reading Corners Project</h3>
      <p>
        Partnering with schools and community centers, we set up mini-libraries to promote literacy, a love of learning, and access to educational materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our programs are fueled by donations, volunteers, and a passionate belief in the potential of every child. We welcome partnerships, sponsorships, and new ideas to grow our impact.
