      <p><strong>Apple of God Foundation</strong> is a charitable arm of the Apple of God Group, dedicated to transforming lives through love, education, and opportunity. Founded on the core belief that <em>"Let Love Lead,"</em> our mission is to support underserved communities—especially children—by providing access to quality education and essential learning materials.</p>
      <p>We believe every child, regardless of background, deserves a chance to learn, grow, and build a better future. That’s why we’ve launched our flagship initiative: <strong>“50 Smiles Back to School”</strong>—aimed at supporting 50 children from low-income families with school supplies at the start of each academic year. This project is fully funded by the foundation and serves as the first of many outreach programs to come.</p>
      <p>Guided by the leadership of visionary changemakers and built on the principles of integrity, compassion, and sustainable impact, the Apple of God Foundation works closely with local schools and communities to identify those most in need and offer timely support.</p>
      <p>Our dream is simple but powerful: to ignite hope, empower young minds, and raise a generation of future leaders—one act of love at a time.</p>
